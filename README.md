# break-free

I originally saw this from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/vnglst/status/1751278052154179770),
which derives from [this other tweet](https://twitter.com/nicolasdnl/status/1749715070928433161).

I implemented the same basic idea using Bevy, for fun and to learn how Bevy
works a bit. The code is heavily based on the [Breakout example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/games/breakout.rs)
from the Bevy project.
